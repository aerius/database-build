 * synchronize_all_serials
 * -----------------------
 * Function to synchronize serials/sequences.
 * All functions with naming convention tablename_columnname_seq are set to the max value of that column in that table.
 *
 * Serials/sequences can get out of sync with the actual content of the database after bulk loads, COPY FROMs and INSERTs without defaults.
 * This function makes sure sequences match the content once again.
 * This is for instance used after a database build.
