/*
 * checksum_all
 * ------------
 * Function to generate checksums for all important database objects.
 * In the case of tables, a separate checksum is made for the structure and the data.
 * For the data checksums some tables can be skipped, for example when the content is dynamic and it does not make sense to check/compare checksums.
 *
 * The (sorted) result of the function can be saved to compare it with another database.
 * For example after patching a production database, to check if it matches the last build.
 *
 * Catalog objects and objects of extensions like PostGIS are automatically filtered out.
 *
 * @param v_excluded_data_tables List of tables for which no data checksum should be generated.
 * @return Per object type a name or description of the object, and the checksum of the definiton/data of that object
